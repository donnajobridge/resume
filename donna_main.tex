\section{\underline{Goal}}
\location{My primary goal is to leverage my 10+ years of experience in research to join a team that utilizes data to design high-quality, innovative solutions to problems. I thrive in a team-oriented environment that values analytical and creative problem solving from individuals with diverse skillsets. My comprehensive research background shows that I am adaptive to new approaches, environments, and ways of thinking, and that I am able to quickly synthesize complex knowledge and follow threads in data to test novel hypotheses. I am an expert at balancing low- level details with overarching project goals.}
